    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Your taste buds will love these tangy, sour, crisp fermented pickles.</p>
    <p>Fermenting dates back thousands of years! Using just water, salt, and the natural bacteria found on the skin of the cucumbers, this recipe is sure to be a hit!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>(3) cucumbers, sliced in spears</li>
        <li>10g (2 tsp) of kosher salt</li>
        <li>(2) 1-pint (473ml) mason jars</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash your cucumbers</li>
        <li>Slice off the ends of the cucumbers</li>
        <li>Slice cucumbers into spears. Make sure the spears are short enough to fit into jars with approx. 1/2 inch of head space.</li>
        <li>Add 10g (2 tsp) of kosher salt into bottom of each mason jar</li>
        <li>Pack spears tightly into jars</li>
        <li>Fill jars with water until spears are submerged</li>
        <li>If necessary, add a weight to keep spears submerged.</li>
        <li>Store jar in a cool, dark place</li>
        <li>Check your jars every couple of days, releasing presure from jars as necessary</li>
        <li>After about 14 days, you can start to taste your pickles. They are done once they reach your desired level of tangy/sour!</li>
        <li>Once you are satisfied, store in the refrigerator! Will keep for many months in the fridge</li>
    </ol>
