# odin-recipes
This project is to create a small recipe website

It will consist of an index.html file with links to recipes, which, at this
 point, I am assuming will each be their own pages within the website.

If this is true, then there will be a pages folder with multiple .html files
for each recipe.

No CSS at this time. 

Skills needed: 

1) html boilerplate
2) Relative linking to pages via <a href=""
3) Relative linking to images via <img src=""
4) alt tags for images
5) ???

Will do a post-project update on README.md
